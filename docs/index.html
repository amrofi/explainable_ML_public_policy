    <h2>Machine Learning Explorer</h2>
    <p>
      This is the homepage for the Machine Learning Explorer, 
      built as part of the Explainable Machine Learning for Public Policy project
      at the UC Berkeley School of Information. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The machine learning explorer allows you to run logistic regression, a type of machine learning,
        on any dataset and visualize the results. You can then test changes to the model
        to explore what would happen if various factors changed. This is intended for
        any time subject-matter experts need to give feedback to machine learning engineers,
        especially when used by governments that want to be transparent about policies implemented
        by machine learning algorithms.

    <p>
        If you would like to use the machine learning explorer, download it from
        <a href="https://github.com/shresh02/explainable_ML_public_policy">https://github.com/shresh02/explainable_ML_public_policy</a>
        and follow the instructions in the README to install. 
        An example database and example files are included in the repository.
